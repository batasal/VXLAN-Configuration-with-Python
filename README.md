# VXLAN Config Automation on N9K Platform with Python

VXLAN requires almost the same configuration to be done repetitively on multiple Spines as well as Leaves. 
So here are two scripts i created and tested on EVE with 2 N9Kv switches as Spines and 3 N9Kv switches as Leaves.
Scripts are configuring only the standard VXLAN parameters, Border Leaf configuration on Leaf-3 is not covered.
